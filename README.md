Encryptor
----------

A simple wrapper for the standard ruby OpenSSL library

Used by `http://github.com/danpal/attr_encrypted` to easily encrypt/decrypt attributes in any class

Installation
-------------

    gem install encryptor2

Usage
-----------

##Basic

Encryptor will use `aes-256-cbc` to encrypt securely. It's highly recommended you use an `iv(initialization vector)` and a `salt`. Encryptor takes this as
options. If you specify an `:iv` you are required to specify a `:salt` too.

The best example is:

    salt = Time.now.to_i.to_s
    secret_key = "secret"
    iv = (OpenSSL::Cipher::Cipher.new('aes-256-cbc').random_iv
    encrypted_value = Encryptor.encrypt('some string to encrypt', :key => secret_key, :iv => iv, :salt => salt)
    decrypted_value = Encryptor.decrypt(encrypted_value, :key => secret_key, :iv => iv, :salt => salt)

The value to encrypt or decrypt may also be passed as the :value option if you'd like.

    encrypted_value = Encryptor.encrypt(:value => 'some string to encrypt', :key => secret_key, :iv => iv, :salt => salt) 
    decrypted_value = Encryptor.decrypt(:value => encrypted_value, :key => secret_key, :iv => iv, :salt => salt)


**You may also skip the salt and the iv if you want so. Doing so, you are on your own!**

    encrypted_value = Encryptor.encrypt(:value => 'some string to encrypt', :key => 'secret') 
    decrypted_value = Encryptor.decrypt(:value => encrypted_value, :key => 'secret')


You may also pass the :algorithm< options but they are not required.

    Encryptor.default_options.merge!(:algorithm => 'aes-128-cbc', :key => 'some default secret key', :iv => iv, :salt => salt)


### Strings

Encryptor adds `encrypt` and `decrypt` methods to String objects for your convenience. These two methods accept the same arguments as the associated ones in the Encryptor module. They're nice when you set the default options in the Encryptor.default_options attribute. For example:

    Encryptor.default_options.merge!(:key => 'some default secret key', :iv => iv, :salt => salt)
    credit_card = 'xxxx xxxx xxxx 1234'
    encrypted_credit_card = credit_card.encrypt

There's also encrypt! and decrypt! methods that replace the contents of a string with the encrypted or decrypted version of itself.

Note on Patches/Pull Requests
------------------------------

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
